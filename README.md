Name: Chirag  Shah

Programming Language : Php, JavaScript, Python 

Motivation:
 - Less infrastructure cost
 - Automation
 - Realtime notifications and analysis
 
Project Setup:
 - Software's:
	- Applets:
		- IFTTT
		- PushBullet
		- Tasker
		- DialogFlow
	- Languages:
		- Php and Python
 - Hardware:
   - DELL Laptop
   - Apple MAC Book Pro
   - HP Laptop

Implementation:
- IFTTT and Pushbullet:
	- General computer operations with backend PHP scripts (e.g. open word, type in word, sleep)
- Tasker:
	- Wake up Computer on LAN
- Dialogflow:
	- Customized interactions to perform computer operations with backend Python script
